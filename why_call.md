# Why use CALL?

### Pros
  * experiential learning
  * motivation
  * enhance student achievement
  * authentic materials for study
  * greater interaction
  * individualization
  * independence from a single source of information
  * global understanding

### Cons (taken from [here](http://www.c3schools.org/MHEC/WebCT/EnglishTeachers_barrierstocall.pdf))
  * financial barriers
  * availability of computer hardware and software
  * technical and theoretical knowledge
  * acceptance of the technology

## How to evaluate a CALL application

1. Does it _increase_ or _decrease_ the workload, for you or your students?
  * If it increases the workload, is it worth it?
1. Does it actually *facilitate* a better approach to teaching/learning? (rather than the `oooh, shiny!` effect)
  * Flipped classroom
  * Learning by doing
1. What is the risk of technical failure?
  * How likely is the technology to fail?
  * If it fails, do I have the resources to recover quickly?
    * Would a failure be catastrophic to your course?
